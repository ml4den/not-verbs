This site is dedicated to informing people about words that are not verbs, even though people misuse them that way.

### Project

This website is based on [notaverb.com](http://notaverb.com/), originally published in 2006. 

It fixes some mistakes made during the generation of the original articles and aims to preserve the project by using more modern technologies.

### Contributing
Articles, code, or ideas can be contributed on [GitHub](https://github.com/ml4den/not-verbs) or through the contact form.
