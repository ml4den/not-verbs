description: '"Backup" Is Not a Verb'

# Backup

Despite what many people --mostly in the computer field-- think, "backup" is not a verb. It's simply not. Whether or not "backup" is a word at all may spark a debate in some circles, but assuming it is then it may act as many parts of speech, but not as a verb.

I will repeat the important part for clarity: "backup" is _not_ a verb. It's simply not.

This site is dedicated to educating people about the common misuses of words like "backup." It is meant for both non-native speakers who may not know any better, and for native speakers who _should_ know better but don't. It is in no way a substitute for a real education. Poor grammar is an excellent way to make any presentation sound stupid --or program look sloppy-- so if you intend to use this language much then it behooves you to learn it properly.

For clarity, I need to point out that this has nothing to do with verbification, or "verbing." It is completely natural for nouns to become verbs and verbs to become nouns; the problem this site addresses is the _manner_ in which that happens for a particular category of word or phrase. This is not an attempt to arrest the evolution of the language, but to correct mistakes.
