# Not Verbs

## About
This project aims to preserve the ageing [notaverb.com](http://notaverb.com) that it is based on while also offering a more modern approach of delivering and maintaining the site's contents.

In addition, this project is aimed at demonstrating the versatility and ease of use of the [Jamstack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamstack) framework.

## Credits
This website is based on notaverb.com, originally published in 2006.

The built pages are delivered via a [fast global network](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) by [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) with [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) running the serverless contact form.

It is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Edition template](https://github.com/CloudCannon/edition-jekyll-template) from CloudCannon.
